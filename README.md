# Intelligent Complaint Analysis for Financial Services: Building a RAG-Powered Chatbot


## Introduction

# 

# CrediTrust Financial, a rapidly growing digital finance company serving East African markets, was facing a critical challenge: thousands of customer complaints were coming in each month through various channels, but internal teams struggled to extract actionable insights from this valuable feedback.

# 

# As a solution, we've developed an intelligent complaint analysis chatbot powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. This tool empowers Product Managers like Asha to quickly understand customer pain points across five major product categories: Credit Cards, Personal Loans, Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL), Savings Accounts, and Money Transfers.

# 

# Our RAG-powered system addresses three key performance indicators:

# 

# 1\. Reducing time to identify complaint trends from days to minutes

# 2\. Empowering non-technical teams to get answers without needing data analysts

# 3\. Shifting from reactive to proactive problem-solving based on real-time feedback

# 

## Technical Choices

# 

### Dataset

# 

# We used complaint data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), filtering it to include only the five specified product categories and removing records with empty complaint narratives.

# 

### Chunking Strategy

# 

# We employed LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with:

# \- Chunk size: 512 tokens

# \- Overlap: 50 tokens

# \- Splitting on: \['\\n\\n', '\\n', '.', ' ', '']

# 

# This strategy balances the need for contextual understanding while maintaining computational efficiency.

# 

### Embedding Model

# 

# We chose `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for its:

# \- Lightweight nature (good for fast inference)

# \- Strong performance on semantic similarity tasks

# \- 384-dimensional vectors that balance accuracy and storage efficiency

# 

### Language Model

# 

# We selected Mistral AI's Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 for its:

# \- Strong instruction-following capabilities

# \- Efficient performance on our hardware

# \- Open-source nature allowing customization

# 

# The system performs well in retrieving relevant information and generating coherent answers. It excels at answering direct questions about specific product categories but sometimes struggles with nuanced comparative analysis.

# 

## UI Showcase
 

# The interactive chat interface allows non-technical users to ask questions in natural language and receive evidence-backed answers. Users can expand the "Show sources" section to see which complaint narratives informed the answer, building trust in the system.

# 

## Conclusion

# 

# Building this RAG-powered chatbot presented several challenges, including handling noisy unstructured text data, optimizing chunking strategies for financial complaint narratives, and fine-tuning the language model to produce insightful summaries.

# 

# Key learnings from this project include:

# \- The importance of careful text chunking for domain-specific content

# \- The value of prompt engineering in guiding LLM responses

# \- The effectiveness of combining semantic search with language models for question answering

# 

# Future improvements could include:

# \- Implementing reranking of retrieved documents

# \- Fine-tuning the LLM on domain-specific financial complaint data

# \- Adding support for multi-hop reasoning to handle complex queries

# \- Incorporating temporal analysis to detect emerging trends over time

# 

# By transforming raw customer complaints into actionable insights, this tool helps CrediTrust Financial shift from reactive to proactive problem-solving, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and business outcomes.
